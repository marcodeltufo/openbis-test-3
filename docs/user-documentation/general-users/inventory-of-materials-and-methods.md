## Customise Collection View

[](## "Print this article")

 

It is possible customise the view of *Collections* in the ELN.

The default *Collection* can have a **Form View** or a **List View**.
Depending on this selection, the collection view will be different.

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/customize-collection-view.png)

 

 

**Form View:** This shows the metadata of the *Collection* along with
the table of objects. This view is useful when a user wants to see
specific metadata for a *Collection*.

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/collections-form-view-1024x575.png)

 

If you do not see the table with the Objects in the form, you need to
enable this by selecting **Show Objects** from the **More..** dropdown

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/collection-form-view-show-objects.png)

 

**List View: **The metadata of the *Collection* is not shown in this
view, but only the table of objects is shown.

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/collection-list-view-1024x408.png)

 

In this case a user would need to click on **More..**, and **Edit**
**Collection** in order to see the metadata and be able to edit the
*Collection*.

## Register single entries in a Collection

[](## "Print this article")

 

 

In this example, we will see how to register one *Object* of type
**Sample** in the **Raw Samples** *Collection.* The same procedure
should be followed to register any other *Object* in other
*Collections*.

 

1.  Click on the **Raw Samples** *Collection* folder in the main menu.
2.  Click the **+ New Sample ** in the main page
3.  Fill in the form
4.  **Save**

 

Please note that the *Object type* shown in the **+New** button (in this
case **Sample**), is what is defined as *default object type* for the
*Collection*. If this is missing in the *Collection,* the button will
not be present.

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/register-single-entry-collection-button-1024x299.png)

 

To register a different object type in the Collection:

 

1.  Select **New Object** from the **More** drop down menu (as shown
    below)
2.  Select the relevant *Object type* from the list *(Sample,* in this
    case*).*
3.  Fill in the form
4.  **Save**

## Batch register entries in a Collection

[](## "Print this article")

 

It is possible to register several samples at once via file upload. Two
methods are currently available:

1.  Batch registration via Excel template file (XLS Batch Register
    Objects)
2.  Batch registration via TSV template file (TSV Batch Register
    Objects)

 

## ![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/batch-register-entries-one-collection-1024x300.png)


![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/warning-sign-1024x904.png)
In openBIS versions prior to 20.10.6, the XLS batch registration is not
recommended to register several hundreds of entries. The use of the TSV
batch upload to register several hundreds of entries is recommended in
those cases.

 

## Batch registration via Excel template file 

 

To register several entries of the same type with an Excel file:

1.  Navigate to the relevant collection (e.g.** Samples**).
2.  Select **XLS Batch Register Object*****s*** from the
    **More*** *drop-down menu (see figure above)
3.  Download the **template** file and fill in the relevant information.
    (Example file:
    [SAMPLE-COLLECTION-REGISTRATION-SAMPLE-STORAGE\_POSITION-template](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SAMPLE-COLLECTION-REGISTRATION-SAMPLE-STORAGE_POSITION-template-2.xlsx))
4.  Upload the file.

 

#### **Codes**

 

In most cases, *Object* types have the option to auto-generate codes set
to true in the admin UI. In this case, openBIS automatically generates
codes and identifiers when *Objects* are registered. If that is not the
case, the code needs to be manually entered by the users in the Excel
template. The current template does not have a **Code** column. This can
however be manually added if codes should be provided by the user and
not automatically generated by openBIS.  If codes should be manually
entered and are missing, openBIS will show the error message
“*UserFailureExceptionmessage: Code cannot be empty for a non auto
generated code.*” 

 

#### **Controlled vocabularies**

 

For Controlled Vocabularies fields, i.e. fields with a drop down menu,
you can enter either the **code** or the **label** of the terms in the
Excel file.

Please note that codes are not case-sensitive, but labels are.

Codes and labels of vocabulary terms can be seen under
**Utilities -&gt; Vocabulary Browser**.

 

#### Assign parents

 

1.  **Assign already existing parents**

 

If the parents you want to assign to your Objects are already registered
in openBIS, in the **Parents** column of the Excel file, you can assign
the relationship, by providing the identifier of the parent (i.e. /SPACE
code/PROJECT code/OBJECT code). If you want to add multiple parents to
one Object, every identifier should be in a new line in the
corresponding Excel cell. A new line in an Excel cell is entered with
the keyboard shortcuts **Alt** + **Enter.**

Example file:
[SAMPLE-COLLECTION-REGISTRATION-ANTIBODY-STORAGE\_POSITION-template](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SAMPLE-COLLECTION-REGISTRATION-ANTIBODY-STORAGE_POSITION-template-1.xlsx)

 

** Note:** no other separators (e.g “,” or  “;”) should be used,
otherwise an error will be thrown.

 

**2. Register Objects and assign parents in the same batch registration
process. **

 

If you want to register a few *Objects* and at the same time establish a
parent-child relationship between some of them, you can do so by using
the **$** and **Parents** columns. In the example below we want to
register 2 *Objects*, antibody 1 and antibody 2. We want to assign
antibody 1 as parent of antibody 2. In the **$ column** corresponding to
antibody 1 we need to enter numbers or letters proceeded by the $ symbol
(i.e. $1, or $parent1). In the **Parents** column of antibody 2, we need
to use the same value used in the **$ column** for antibody 1.

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/register-objects-assign-parents-in-same-transaction.png) 

 

#### Date format

For date fields, the expected format is YYYY-MM-DD.

 

### Register storage positions and samples in the same XLS file

 

A **sample** and its **storage** **position** can be registered
together, as shown in the template provided above:

 

-   The info in the **$** column of the **sample** spreadsheet should
    match the **Parents** column in **Storage Positions** spreadsheet.
    In the $ column you can enter numbers or letters proceeded by the $
    symbol (i.e. $1, $2 or $parent1, $parent2)**.**

 

## Batch registration via TSV template file

 

1.  Select **TSV** **Batch Register Object*****s*** from the
    **More*** *drop-down menu
2.  Select the *Object* type (E.g. Sample or Storage)
3.  Download the **template** file and fill in the relevant information
4.  Upload the file

** **

### **Rules to follow to fill in the template .tsv file**

 

1.  **Identifiers**:
    1.  Identifiers are given by **/SPACE code/PROJECT code/OBJECT
        code**, e.g **/MATERIALS/EQUIPMENT/INS1**. Users can provide
        their own identifiers, or these can be automatically generated
        by openBIS.
    2.  To have identifiers automatically generated by openBIS,
        completely remove the **identifier** column from the file.
2.  **Lists**. In fields that have lists to choose from (called
    **Controlled Vocabularies**), the code of the term needs to be
    entered. Term codes can be seen under **Utilities -&gt; Vocabulary
    Browser**.
3.  **Parents**. Use the following syntax to enter parents:
    **identifier1, identifier2, identifier3.**
4.  **Parents annotations**. Use the following syntax to annotate
    parents:
    **identifier:xxx;COMMENTS:xxxx\identifier:yyy;COMMENTS:yyyy**. Where
    **COMMENTS** is the property used for the annotation in this case
    (to be replaced with the actual property used).
5.  **Date fields**. The expected syntax for dates is YYYY-MM-DD.


## Advantages of XLS batch registration vs the old batch registration

 

1.  XLS batch registration uses labels instead of codes in the column
    headers in the template file.
2.  Fields which are Controlled Vocabularies can use labels instead of
    codes.
3.  The template can be used as it is, and no modifications are
    necessary by removing the identifier column, as it was in case of
    the old batch registration.
4.  Upload of samples and storage positions can now be performed using
    single template file. 

 

The *old* batch register mode is being maintained for backward
compatibility and will be phased out.

## Batch register entries in several Collections

[](## "Print this article")

 

It is possible to batch register *Objects* that belong to different
*Collections*.

This can be done from the **Object Browser** page, under **Utilities**.
Two options are available:

 

1.  **XLS Batch Register Objects**: batch registration via Excel
    template file.
2.  **TSV Batch Register Objects**: batch registration via .tsv template
    file.

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/batch-register-entries-object-browser.png)

 

### XLS Batch Register Objects

 

This option for batch registration is available since openBIS version
20.10.3. It allows to register *Objects* of different types to multiple
*Collections*.

You can select which types you want to register from the list of
available types.

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/object-broswer-types-selection.png)

 

You can then download the template that will allow you to register
*Objects* of the selected types to single or multiple *Collections*. The
*Space, Project, Collection* need to be entered in the file. The
complete path for *Projects* and *Collections* need to be used, as shown
in this example file:
[SAMPLE-GENERAL-REGISTRATION-EXPERIMENTAL\_STEP-MASS\_MEASUREMENT-SAMPLE-template](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SAMPLE-GENERAL-REGISTRATION-EXPERIMENTAL_STEP-MASS_MEASUREMENT-SAMPLE-template.xlsx)

 

### TSV Batch Register Objects

 

The batch registration via .tsv file allows to batch register only one
type of *Object* at a time. *Objects* however can be registered to
several *Collections*.

This batch upload method is kept for backward compatibility, but it will
be phased out.

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/object-browse-batch-reister.png)

 

In this case, if *Objects* are to be registered to multiple
*Collections*, an **identifier** for the *Objects* needs to be provided,
as shown below. This is not the case with the XLS batch registration,
where identifiers can be automatically generated by openBIS.

## Batch update entries in a Collection

[](## "Print this article")

 

It is possible to modify the values of one or more fields in several
objects simultaneously via batch update. This can be done in two ways:

 

1.  **XLS Batch Update Objects**
2.  **TSV Batch Update Objects**

 

 

### XLS Batch Update Objects

 

1.  Navigate to the relevant collection (e.g. **Raw Samples**).
2.  In the Collection table, from the **Columns,** select **Identifier**
    and the field(s) you want to update (e.g. **Source**), as shown
    below

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Batch-update-entries-one-collection-column-selection-1024x584.png)

3\. If you have several entries you can filter the table
(see [Tables](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation-20-10-3/additional-functionalities/tables/))

4\. **Export** the table choosing the options **Import Compatible= YES;
Selected Columns; All pages/Current page/Selected rows** (depending on
what you want to export)**.**

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/export-tables-1024x419.png)

5\. Modify the file you just exported and save it.

6\. Select **XLS Batch Update Objects** from the **More..** dropdown

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/collection-XLS-batch-update-menu.png)

6\. Upload the file you saved before and click **Accept**. Your entries
will be updated.

 

**Note**: 

If a column is removed from the file or a cell in a column is left empty
the corresponding values of updated samples will be preserved.

To delete a value or a parent/child connection from openBIS one needs to
enter   
![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-10-13-at-15.59.01.png)
  into the corresponding cell in the XLS file.


### TSV Batch Update Objects

 

1.  Navigate to the relevant collection (e.g. **Raw Samples**).

2\. Select **TSV** **Batch Update Objects** from the **More…** dropdown.

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/collection-TSV-batch-update-menu.png)

 

3\. Select the relevant *Object* *type*, e.g. **Sample **

 

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/old-batch-update.png)

4\. Download the available **template**

5\. Fill in the **identifiers** of the objects you want to update
(identifiers are unique in openBIS. This is how openBIS knows what to
update). You can copy the identifiers from the identifier column in the
table and paste them in the file. Identifiers have this format:
/MATERIALS/SAMPLES/SAMPLE1.

6\. Fill in the values in the columns you want to update

7\. Save the file and upload it via the **XLS Batch Update
Objects** from the **More..** dropdown

 

**Note**:

If a column is removed from the file or a cell in a column is left empty
the corresponding values of updated samples will be preserved.

To delete a value/connection from openBIS one needs to enter
![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-10-13-at-15.59.01-1.png) or
**\_ \_DELETE\_ \_** into the corresponding cell in the file.
