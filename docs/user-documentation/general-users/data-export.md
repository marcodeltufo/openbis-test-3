### Export Lab Notebooks

  
All levels of the *Lab Notebook* and *Inventory* can be exported, using
the 2 export options in the **More..** drop down, as shown below. It is
possible to export metadata only, or metadata and data (up to 10 GBs).

In this way, users can export their complete lab notebook with all data
contained in it. Everything is exported to a zip file, which maintains
the same structure used in openBIS. Each folder contains several file
formats (*.txt, .html, .json, .docx*) with the metadata of the
corresponding *Project, Experiment, Object and Datasets* (see below).

A link to download the zip file is sent via email to the user. Email
notification needs to be configured by a *system admin* during or after
installation, as explained in [Configure Data Store
Server](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Installation+and+Administrators+Guide+of+the+openBIS+Data+Store+Server)
[.](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc1906/Installation+and+Administrators+Guide+of+the+openBIS+Data+Store+Server)


In a similar way, it is possible to export *Projects*, *Experiments,
Objects, Dataset*s.

###  Export Builder

  
It is also possible to export the content of openBIS using the
**Export** **to ZIP** under **Exports** in the **Utilities** main menu.
 Here users can select items from different *Spaces* and export them by
clicking the **Export Selected** button.

 

Also in this case, a link to download the data is sent to the user via
email, as described above.

## Export to Zenodo

[](## "Print this article")

  
Currently openBIS offers an integration with the **Zenodo** data
repository ([https://zenodo.org/).](https://zenodo.org/)

  
This enables data direct data transfer from openBIS to Zenodo. First of
all the connection to Zenodo needs to be configured by a *system admin*
in the DSS service.properties (see [How to configure the openBIS
DSS)](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Installation+and+Administrators+Guide+of+the+openBIS+Data+Store+Server)
If this is configured, a lab manager, who has admin rights for the
**Settings,** needs to enable it in the ELN, as explained in [Enable
Transfer to Data
Repositories](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-openbis-19-06-4/enable-transfer-to-data-repositories/)**.**

###  Create Zenodo Personal Access Token

  
In order to be able to export data to Zenodo, you need a valid Zenodo
account. You also need to create a **personal access token.** This can
be done from the **Applications** under **Settings** in Zenodo, as shown
below:

![](https://openbis.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/generate-zenodo-token-1024x498.png)

### Save Zenodo Personal Access Token in openBIS

  
After creating the personal access token in Zenodo, this needs to be
stored in openBIS, with the following procedure:

1.  Go to **User Profile** under **Utilities** in the main menu.
2.  Enable editing.
3.  Add the personal access token from Zenodo.
4.  **Save.**

    the main menu.

After you hit the **Publish** button in Zenodo, a new entry with the
details of this submission will be created in the **Publications**
folder in the **Inventory**. Please note that this may take a few
minutes.
