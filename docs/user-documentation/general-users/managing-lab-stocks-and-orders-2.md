Managing Lab Stocks and Orders
==============================



  
It is possible to use openBIS to manage
stocks of products and create orders of products to buy for the
lab. 

Every lab member can register products and place requests of products to
buy. The requests can be converted into orders by the lab manager or the
person responsible for purchases in the lab. The orders created with
openBIS contain the information that can be sent to the suppliers.

In the **Stock Catalog** folder, a lab can create one collection of all
products purchased in the lab and one collection of all suppliers used
for purchasing. Each product must be linked to 1 supplier. 

Every lab member by default has *Space User* access rights to the
**Stock Catalog** folder and is able to register products, suppliers and
place requests for products to buy.

The **Stock Orders** folder is visible to all lab members, who have by
default *Space Observer* rights to it.  The lab manager, or person
responsible for purchases, has *Space Admin* rights to this Space.
Orders can be created based on the requests placed in the **Stock
Catalog**.

STOCK ORDERS
----

 

This section is accessible by default by every lab member. However, by
default, only the person in charge of lab purchases can process orders
based on the requests created in the Stock Catalog by every lab member.

 Processing product orders from requests
^^^^

 

To create orders of products from requests created in the Stock Catalog:

> 1.  Go to the **Order Collection**
>     folder under **Stock** *-&gt;* **Stock Orders***-&gt;* **Orders**
>     in the main menu.
> 2.  Click the **+ New Order** button in
>     the *Collection* page.

..image:: img/)).
> If no template is available, the relevant fields in the form need to

> options are **Delivered**, **Paid**,
> **Ordered**, **Not yet ordered**. When you first create the order, you
> should set the status to **Not yet ordered**.
>

If the price information is available in the products, the total cost of
the order is calculated by openBIS and displayed in the order form, as
shown above.

By using the **Print Order** button in the order form, the order can be
printed as text file that can be sent to the suppliers for purchasing
the products.

To simplify the process of ordering multiple products from the same
supplier, all information related to the same supplier is grouped in one
single text file. 

In the example presented in the picture above, there are 2 products to
buy from fluka and 1 product to buy from Sigma-Aldrich. In this case the
two attached files have been printed from the Order form in openBIS,
using the **Print Order** button:
..image:: img/order_ORD1_p0.txt)
..image:: img/order_ORD1_p1.txt)

 

Once the order is processed, you should
change the **Order Status** to
**Ordered**. This will
automatically change the **Order Status**<span
style="color: #000000;"> in all connected requests. Requests with this
oder status cannot be added to additional orders.
