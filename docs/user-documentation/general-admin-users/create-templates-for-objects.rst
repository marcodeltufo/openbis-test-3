Create Templates for Objects
============================



  
It is possible to create templates for *Objects*. Templates are useful
when one has to register repetitive *Experimental steps* or
*measurements* where some fields should always be pre-defined.

For each *Object* type several templates can be created. This can be
done by the lab manager, who should have admin rights for editing the
**Settings**. It is not necessary to be *Instance admin* for this. In a
multi-group set up, this can be done by the *group admin*.

  
Procedure:  
  

1.  Go to the **Settings**, under **Utilities**
2.  Scroll down to the **Templates** section
3.  From the **New Template** tab select select the *Object type* for
    which you want to have a template.
