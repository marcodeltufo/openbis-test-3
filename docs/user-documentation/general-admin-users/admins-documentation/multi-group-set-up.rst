Multi Group Set Up
====
 
General ELN Settings
----



 

In a multi-group instance an *Instance admin* can customise the General
ELN Settings.

 

The Settings can be access from the main menu, under **Utilities**.

The General ELN Settings are Settings that are not specific to any of
the defined groups group , as shown below.

 

.. image:: img/settings-selection-multigroup.png

 

The General ELN Settings consist of two parts:

 

1.  **Instance Settings**. These settings affect the whole instance, it
    is not possible to customise them on a group level.
2.  **Group Settings**. These settings affect all general *Spaces* that
    do not belong to any group defined in the configuration file
    (see [openBIS set up for multi group
    instances](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/User+Group+Management+for+Multi-groups+openBIS+Instances)).
    This is the case, for example, if *Spaces* are manually created and
    they do not belong to any group (see [Create new ELN
    Spaces](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/space-management/create-new-eln-spaces/)).

Spaces that do not belong to any group do not have a group prefix. In
the example below **Publications** do not belong to any group in the
Inventory.

and **Horizon**, **Snf** do not belong to any group in the Lab notebook.

Instance Settings
----

 

1.  **Custom widget**s. This section allows to enable the Rich Text
    Editor or Spreadsheet component for a given field, as described
    in [Enable Rich Text Editor or Spreadsheet
    Widgets;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/new-entity-type-registration/enable-rich-text-editor-or-spreadsheet-widgets/)
2.  **Forced Monospace Font**. This section allows to force the use of
    monospace font (i.e. fixed width) for selected MULTILINE\_VARCHAR
    properties. This is useful for example for plasmid sequences.
3.  **Dataset types for filenames**. This section allows to associate
    files with a given extension to a specific dataset type, as
    described in [Associate File Types to Dataset
    Types](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/associate-file-types-to-dataset-types/).

 

 

Group Settings
----

 

1.  **Storages**. In this section the storages for samples to be used in
    *Spaces* not belonging to any predefined group (see above), can be
    created, as described in [Configure Lab
    Storage;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-inventory-of-materials-and-samples/configure-lab-storage/)
2.  **Templates**. In this section, the templates for a given *Object
    type* to be used in *Spaces* not belonging to any predefined group
    (see above) can be created, as described in [Create Templates for
    Objects](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/create-templates-for-objects/);
3.  **Object types definition extension**. In this section, it is
    possible to:
    1.  Define if one *Object type* is a protocol. If an *Object type*
        is defined as a protocol, it is possible to create a local copy
        of it under an Experiment, when linking to it as a parent, as
        described in [Enable Protocols in
        Settings;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-inventory-of-protocols/enable-protocols-in-settings/)
    2.  Enable the storage widget for an *Object type,* as described
        in [Enable Storage Widget on Sample
        Forms](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-inventory-of-materials-and-samples/enable-storage-widget-on-sample-forms/)
    3.  Define if the *Object type* should be shown in drop downs, as
        described in [Enable Objects in
        dropdowns](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/new-entity-type-registration/enable-objects-in-dropdowns/);
    4.  Define if the *Object type* should be shown in the main menu
        under the Lab notebook section. By default objects are not shown
        in the main menu in the Inventory section.
    5.  Customise the *Parents* and *Children* sections for an *Object
        type* as described in [Customise Parents and Children Sections
        in Object
        Forms](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-parents-and-children-sections-in-object-forms/);
4.  **Inventory Spaces**. It is possible to move *Spaces* from the
    Inventory section to the Lab notebook section and vice-versa as
    described in [Move Spaces between Lab Notebook and
    Inventory](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/space-management/move-space-between-lab-notebook-and-inventory/)
5.  **Main menu**. The main menu for the *Spaces* that do not belong to
    any predefined group (see above) can be customised here, as
    described in [Customise the Main
    Menu;](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation/customise-the-main-menu/)
6.  **Miscellaneous**. In this section it is possible to:
    1.  Show the dataset archiving buttons in *Spaces* that do not
        belong to any predefined group. Please note that this is not
        available by default, but the infrastructure for [archiving to
        tapes](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/user-documentation/data-archiving/)
        (StrongBox/StrongLink) needs to be put in place by a *system
        admin ([Multi data set
        archiving](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Multi+data+set+archiving))*.
    2.  Hide sections by default in *Spaces* that not belong to any
        predefined group. By default some sections in some forms are
        hidden:
        1.  Description in *Spaces* and *Projects*.
        2.  Identification info in *Spaces*, *Projects*, *Experiments*,
            *Objects*, *Datasets*.

By unchecking this option, these sections will be shown by default.
