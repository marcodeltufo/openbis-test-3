Inventory overview
==================



The default Inventory contains two
folders: **Materials** and **Methods**.

These are used to organise respectively samples and materials of any
type and lab protocols.

Samples, materials and protocols are
modelled in openBIS as *Objects*. In the openBIS ELN-LIMS for life
sciences, the following Object types are preconfigured in the
database:

 

    Antibodies, Chemicals, Enzymes, Media, Solutions and Buffers, Plasmids, Plants, Oligos, 
    RNAs, Bacteria, Cell lines, Flies, Yeasts, General protocols, PCR protocols, Western blotting protocols.

 

These *Objects* are organised in
*Collections* in the **Materials** and **Methods** sections of the
Inventory .

The generic openBIS ELN-LIMS only has one
predefined *Object* type for the Inventory:

 

    General Protocol 

 

Additional *Object* types and the
corresponding *Collections* must be created by the *Instance admin*,
based on the needs of the lab.

 

It is possible to add additional folders in the Inventory, for example
for **Equipment** (see **[Create new Inventory
Spaces](https://openbis.ch/index.php/docs/admin-documentation-20-10-3/space-management/create-new-inventory-spaces/))**.
